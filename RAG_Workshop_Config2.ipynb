      "The mathematical constraint that differentiates Ridge regression (L2) from Lasso regression (L1) is found in their respective penalty terms. According to Alok Choudhary's article on Medium titled \"Ridge , Lasso, and Elastic Net Regression,\" the key intuition behind Ridge regression involves a penalty term that penalizes large coefficients by using squared values of the coefficient estimates:\n",
